## Introduction
 I decided to take on this project to build a useful application that uses an remote API to update the DOM. Pivotal Tracker's API was a great choice as it is an amazing agile resource. It's been a blast learning the Pivotal Tracker API and quickly became a meta app making process. As it evolved, I was using the app I making to efficently make the app I'm using :) This process has also taught me the ins and outs of building a clean UI that is satisfying to use!
